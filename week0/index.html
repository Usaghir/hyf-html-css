		<h2>Experience creating it</h2>


			<p class= "text-in-page"> <strong>It was really fun creating it </strong> I am not an expert programmer, but I can understand the basics of programming. I am a quick learner and can understand logic behind. It was really fun creating the game and the reason is that this assignment was very different as compared to the most traditional ones in which student have to write the text with multiple headings after reading the some topic or mostly that stuff without knowing what will be the actual pupose of doing that task but here the case was different as I have to make a game in which I used my own creativity and I can see as well that what I am creating so I liked that too much and I will definitely love to do train my self at HackTheFuture.   </p>
